## testingtesting

Testing view controllers in iOS can be tricky. This is a sample project using [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/kiwi) that shows a few workarounds.

See related blog post at [Gunosy tech blog](http://gunosy.github.io/2014/08/06/testing-vcs-in-kiwi.html). **(Japanese)**

#### Topics covered:  
1. Calling `-viewDidLoad`  
2. Fiddling with `NSUserDefaults` cleanly  
3. Calling `-viewDidAppear`  
4. Testing asynchronous code directly 
5. Checking that a `UIAlertView` appeared
